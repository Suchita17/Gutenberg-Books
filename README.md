# Assignment

•   Using the JSON web API for Project Gutenberg ebook metadata (Site: https://gutendex.com/)
•   Use this query: /books?author_year_start=1900&author_year_end=1901&languages=en
•   For each book the application must use a Circular Linked List to store all the authors and their birth dates.
•   The application must use a Bubble Sort to sort the authors in descending order based on their birth date.
•   The application can then output the sorted authors to screen
•   The application will also have the option to export the authors in sort order as a CSV file.


The UI used for the program (webapp, console app, etc) is up to the discretion of the developer.
Your solution should be uploaded to github.com, once done email through the link to the github repository for review.

Please demonstrate use of version control (git), design patterns, frameworks, unit testing, and documentation.
If you are uncomfortable uploading the solution to github.com please create a local git repository and then email through the local repository in a password protected zip file.

Please note that the people reviewing this solution will be behind a corporate fire wall so please include a prebuilt version of the solution that the reviewer can run to demonstrate it working.  Also please include examples of the application working in your response.  The corporate firewall will also block file download sites like google drive so please either use github or a password protected zip file.

If you have any questions or need something clarified please email them through and we will respond.
